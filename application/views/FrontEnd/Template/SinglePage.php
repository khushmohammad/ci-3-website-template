                    <p>
                        One important mineral, phosphate, encourages the growth of tissues, the health of all plant cells, and higher agricultural yields. Our goal is to provide customers with a high-quality, organic fertilization solution that is pure, devoid of pollutants, high in accessible phosphorus, and water soluble. Our comprehensive study has shown that our PROM performs best in soils with an acidic or pH-neutral pH, while it can also be used successfully in soils with an alkaline pH when paired with humate, sulfur, or amino. There is also strong evidence that using our PROM in place of some conventional fertilizer applications (Urea or DAP) improves pathogen defense, improves soil health, extends phosphate availability, and decreases soil carbon footprint.
